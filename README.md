# stable-diffusion-webui-offline-launch
Allows you to launch stable diffusion based off [this](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/1523) hacky solution by @kiancn but made to update itself every time you launch it so that if you update webui it shouldn't break.

To use this simply drag and drop these into your base directory then use webui-user-offline.bat to launch in offline mode
